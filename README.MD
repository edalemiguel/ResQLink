## Problem
Disasters such as fires, floods, and earthquakes can escalate quickly if not detected early.  
While AI can automate detection, it can also trigger **false alarms**, wasting valuable emergency resources.  

There‚Äôs a need for a system that blends **AI efficiency** with **human judgment** ‚Äî a *human-in-the-loop* approach that keeps people involved in critical decision-making while maintaining fast response times.

---

## Solution
- **Automatic Detection:** ResQLink automatically detects potential disasters using data from sensors, cameras, or APIs.  
- **Human Verification:** A human verifier (e.g., an emergency staff member) reviews each alert.  
- **Automated Response:** Once verified, the system automatically sends notifications to relevant responders such as the fire department, police, or medical teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Detection:**  
   Uses AI models or APIs to detect signs of a disaster (e.g., smoke, flooding, seismic activity).  
2. **Human Verification:**  
   Sends the detection data (image, location, or reading) to a dashboard where a human verifies if it‚Äôs a real emergency.  
3. **Approval:**  
   Once confirmed, the system automatically triggers alerts to the right authorities.  
4. **Response Tracking:**  
   The system tracks the response status and updates in real time.
